        <h2>Here's a time line of Dr. Turing's life:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>1912</b>- Alan Mathison Turing is born on June 23rd in London, England, to Julius Mathison Turing and Ethel Sara Stoney

</li>
          <li><b>1926</b> - Turing's interest in science and mathematics is evident during his school years at Sherborne School, Dorset

</li>
          <li><b>1931</b> - Enters King's College, Cambridge, studies mathematics and earns first-class honors. He is influenced by a number of mathematicians and logicians who prompt him to question the basis of mathematics

</li>
          <li><b>1936</b> - Develops the concept of a universal machine, capable of solving any mathematical problem given the right inputs and enough time. This theoretical machine forms the basis for modern computer science

</li>
          <li><b>1938</b> - Attends Princeton University for his PhD, expands on the concept of a universal machine and further develops the concept of computable numbers, also starts studying cryptology

</li>
          <li><b>1939</b> - Returns to England at the start of WWII, joins the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, working on breaking German ciphers. His work, in particular on the Bombe machine that deciphered the Enigma-encoded messages, is fundamental to the Allies' war effort

</li>
          <li><b>1945</b> - With the end of WWII, Turing moves to the National Physical Laboratory and begins work on an Automatic Computing Engine (ACE), a stored-program computer. Delays in the building of the ACE lead him to leave the NPL

</li>
          <li><b>1948</b> - Joins Max Newman at the Royal Society Computing Machine Laboratory at the University of Manchester, where he continues his work on the development of software for one of the earliest stored-program computersâ€”the Manchester Mark 1

</li>
          <li><b>1950</b> - Publishes a paper detailing the concept of artificial intelligence and introduces the Turing Test, a measure of a machine's ability</li>
        </ul>
<p>"Alan Turing, the visionary mathematician, who more than anyone else made the modern world possible. It was his vision of 'universal computing' that turned the computer from a mere calculator into a machine that could do anything - that could simulate the logic of any machine."-Andrew Hodges, author of the definitive biography on Alan Turing, "Alan Turing: The Enigma</p>
